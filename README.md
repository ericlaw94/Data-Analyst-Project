Renting a bike from theFord GoBike System is a fantastic (healthy and environmentally friendly) way of moving around in the city for short distance, both for enjoyment and work. There are two types of clients using the system: Subscribers and Customers. Subscribers are primarily daily commuters, having short trips to and from work, who rent a bike on weekdays at 8-9am and 5-6pm, and, occasionally around lunch time. Customers are usually tourists or occassional riders who use the system mainly on weekends to explore the Bay Area.

Age is also a factor within user type. Subscribers who fall in the age group between 25-35 years old are the most common age group to use the bike sharing system.
